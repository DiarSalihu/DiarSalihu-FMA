            <p>Here if we press <u>Next Page</u>, it will take us to the second part of the page, where the other
                questions
                are, from 11th-20th question. Then if we press the underlined <u>Answers</u> it will take us right away
                to
                the answer of that question. So if we press the answer of question 5,7,10,17 or the other questions, we
                will
                automaticlly go to the answer of that qustion like: answer 5,7,10,17 or the other ones.</p>

            <p>Here if we also press <u>Previous Page</u>, it will take us to the page of the questions from 1st-10th
                question.
                But if we press the <u>Next Page</u> it will take us to the next page where the answers of the questions
                are.</p>

            <p>Also, here in the end of the pop quiz, we are in the aswer part. If we press the underlined <u>Back to
                    Question</u>, it will take us to the question of that answer. Like for example:
                if we click in the answer 9,16,19,20, or the other answers, it will take us to that part of that
                question; the question 9,16,19,20 or the other answers that we have clicked.
