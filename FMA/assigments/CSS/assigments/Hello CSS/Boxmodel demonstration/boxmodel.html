    <p>Hi, I am doing my homework in VS code.
       The homewrk is about boxmodeling, and it is possible doing by
       HTML and CSS(Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets).
       In this homework, I need to do a 50 word paragraph, with style.css. 
       HTML and CSS are programming languages for web developers. 

    </p>
