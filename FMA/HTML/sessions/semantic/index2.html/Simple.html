                    In 1938, during the Japanese era, Lee Byung-chul (1910–1987), a member of a large landowning family
                    in Ginei moved to nearby Taikyu and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha
                    Mitsuboshi Shōkai)), or Samsung Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company
                    with forty employees located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong).[15] It dealt in dried fish,[15]
                    locally-grown groceries and noodles.[16] The company prospered and Lee moved its head office to
                    Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to leave Seoul. He started a sugar
                    refinery in Pusan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, Lee founded Cheil Mojik, a textiles company, and
                    built the first plant in Chimsan-dong, Taegu. It was the largest woollen mill in the country at the
                    time of construction.[17]

                    Samsung diversified into various areas as Lee aimed to establish the company as a leader across
                    multiple industries. The business expanded into sectors such as insurance, securities, and retail.
